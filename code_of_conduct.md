As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof) and blockchain/crypto currency affinity.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community.

We invite all those who participate in the Assembly to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Culture

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open culture by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If would like to see participants making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent.

## 5. Trading Crypro Assets

* educate people about wallet software, key management and the secure verification of transactions 
* respect and encourage privacy
* be discreet     

## 6. Representing Corporations 

The CCC Congress is not a trade fair by any means, there is a strong emphasis on keeping the assembly as much as possible 
free from marketing material and overly corporate representation. The idea is that we teach, discuss and evaluate the technology rather than just to promote it.
